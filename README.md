# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis

## 1Overview

This project is about AtliQ Grands, a well-known company that runs a chain of luxury five-star hotels across India. Recently, theyâ€™ve been struggling with tough competition, which has led to a drop in their market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel industry. The reason behind this decline is poor management decisions. To address the issue, the revenue management team is using business and data insights to find and fix the problems that are hurting their business.
